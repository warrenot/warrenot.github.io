            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li> ½ (6 ounce) can tomato paste, or to taste</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon sea salt, or to taste</li>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm water and vegetable bouillon in a slow cooker on
                High until dissolved. Add lentils, carrots, and potatoes.</li> <br>
            <li> Heat a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add cumin and coriander and 
                cook and stir until fragrant, about 20 seconds. 
                Add oil, followed by onion. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes.
                 Add garlic and saute for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer 
                 to the slow cooker. Stir. Add tomato paste, salt, and pepper. Stir in spinach.</li> <br>
            <li>Cook on High, stirring every 30 minutes, until lentils are tender and stew has thickened, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
            <h3>Cook's Notes:
                You can use 5 cups pre-made vegetable broth instead of water and bouillon.
        
                Add more liquid if it's too thick for you. It's so flavorful that adding water won't affect it much. But only add an extra cup or so, no more.
        
                You can follow these directions using a large pot and cooking on your stove over low heat for several hours instead of using a slow cooker.</h3>
